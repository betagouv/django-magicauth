# To add magicauth to your site, you need to add these values to your site settings
# (the rest have defaults, you are free to change them if you want):
# MAGICAUTH_FROM_EMAIL : e.g. 'contact@mysite.com'
# MAGICAUTH_LOGGED_IN_REDIRECT_URL_NAME : e.g. 'home'
#
# Note : for the default templates to be picked up, you need to enable
# the app_directories template Loader, by setting TEMPLATES app_dirs to True.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/templates/api/#django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader

# Note 2 : magicauth assumes your logout url name is 'logout'.
# If it's not, add MAGICAUTH_LOGOUT_URL_NAME in your settings.
